My repo for GA pre-work assignment

Please note - I very much messed up setting Github up when I started this project. So, somewhere in unit 5 or 6, I had to go back and redo the git repository for this project. My apologies if it makes the progress harder to track.

For the first pulse check, Iâ€™ve absolutely highlighted that there should be more focus on git.
